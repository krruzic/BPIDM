# BPIDM
An Interactive Menu for a popular Canadian Restaurant ;)

BPIDM is a menu and ordering system designed for a tablet and built with WPF. 
To facilitate this, all navigation and interaction takes place in a single window. Each screen transition fills the main page while leaving a constant 'header' and 'footer' bar visible. The footer displays relevant information to the current order (or a clippy-like helper if empty) while the header shows global operations such as flagging a server, viewing your overall bill and information about your visit (server name and table number).

## Main Features
All common interactions with a paper menu a customer would have are supported by BPIDM, and then some. We designed the interface to be familiar to the average restaurant goer for ease of access, while at the same time providing added utility through navigation and customization of one's order.

### Menu Searching, filtering and quicknav
The menu can be filtered down through two mechanisms: the search bar (to search by name) or through the filter tags seen next to it. The menu can also be quickly jumped to any category through the sidebar.

### Help
Every page has a conveniently accessible Help Button, customized to provide optimal information

### Bill Splitting
A bill can be split in one of two ways: concurrently as items are added to an order, or at the end when the guests are ready to pay

### Running
Download the exe from master and run it. That's all! Needs .NET 4.5 runtime which is on almost every system.
Built on Windows 10 with VS2015
